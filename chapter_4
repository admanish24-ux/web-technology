# Differentiate between Legibility and Readability.
Legibility refers to how easily individual characters (letters, numbers) can be distinguished from one another.
Readability refers to how easily a block of text can be read and understood as a whole, influenced by layout, line spacing, and font size.

# What is the “Rule of Thirds” in layout design?
The Rule of Thirds divides a page into a 3×3 grid. Important elements are placed along the grid lines or at their intersections to create a balanced, visually appealing, and engaging layout.

# Explain the “F-Pattern” of scanning and how it influences content placement on a web page.
The F-Pattern describes how users typically scan web pages:
First, they scan horizontally across the top
Then, a shorter horizontal scan below
Finally, a vertical scan down the left side
Design implications:
Place important content and headings at the top
Align key information along the left side
Use bold headings and bullet points to catch attention

# Discuss the psychological impact of colors in web design. Give examples of Blue, Red, and Green.
Colors influence user emotions and behavior:
Blue: Represents trust, calmness, and professionalism
Used in: Corporate websites, banks, social media platforms
Red: Conveys urgency, energy, and excitement
Used in: Call-to-action buttons, sales, alerts
Green: Symbolizes growth, health, and nature
Used in: Environmental sites, health and wellness platforms, finance apps

# Explain the “60-30-10 Rule” regarding color balance on a website.
The 60-30-10 Rule is a guideline for creating a balanced color scheme:
60%: Primary color (background)
30%: Secondary color (sections or containers)
10%: Accent color (buttons, highlights, call-to-action)
This rule ensures visual harmony, prevents clutter, and guides user attention effectively.

A website loads very slowly, causing users to abandon it. Upon inspection, you find the
developer used high-resolution raw images directly from a camera. Explain the importance
of Image Optimization and file formats (JPEG vs PNG) to solve this.
9. You are designing a website for a Law Firm. The client wants to use a bright yellow
background with Comic Sans font to look ”friendly.” As a web designer, critique this choice
based on Color Theory and Typography principles, and suggest a better alternative.
10. A website looks great on a laptop but is unreadable on a mobile phone because the user has
to zoom in and scroll horizontally. Identify the design principle missing here and explain
how Media Queries/Fluid Grids could fix it. long ans 

Here are clear, well-structured long answers (4 marks each) written in an exam-friendly style:

#. Importance of Image Optimization and File Formats (JPEG vs PNG)
Image optimization is crucial for improving website performance and user experience. Using high-resolution raw images directly from a camera greatly increases file size, which leads to slow page loading, higher bandwidth usage, and user abandonment.
Importance of Image Optimization:
Reduces image file size without noticeable loss of quality
Improves page load speed
Enhances SEO ranking
Saves server bandwidth and improves performance on mobile devices
File Formats:
JPEG (JPG):Uses lossy compression
Best for photographs and complex images
Smaller file size and faster loading
PNG:
Uses lossless compression
Supports transparency
Best for logos, icons, and images with sharp edges or text
Larger file size compared to JPEG
Conclusion:
Optimizing images by resizing them to required dimensions and choosing the correct format (JPEG for photos, PNG for graphics) significantly improves website speed and usability.

# Critique of Using Bright Yellow Background and Comic Sans for a Law Firm Website
A law firm website must convey trust, professionalism, and credibility. Using a bright yellow background with Comic Sans violates key principles of Color Theory and Typography.
Color Theory Issues:
Bright yellow is visually overwhelming and causes eye strain
It conveys playfulness and caution rather than seriousness
It reduces readability, especially for long text

Typography Issues:
Comic Sans is an informal, playful font
It lacks authority and professionalism
It damages the brand image of a law firm

Better Alternatives:
Colors: Navy blue, dark gray, or deep green for trust and stability
Fonts: Serif fonts (Times New Roman, Georgia) or professional sans-serif fonts (Roboto, Open Sans)
Design Outcome: A clean, calm, and credible interface that aligns with legal professionalism

# Missing Design Principle and Use of Media Queries / Fluid Grids
The missing design principle is Responsive Web Design.
A website that looks good on a laptop but fails on mobile devices provides a poor user experience due to unreadable text and horizontal scrolling.

How Media Queries Help:
Allow CSS to apply different styles based on screen size
Adjust font sizes, layouts, and spacing for mobile screens
Hide or stack elements appropriately

How Fluid Grids Help:
Use percentage-based widths instead of fixed pixels
Allow layouts to adapt smoothly to different screen sizes
Prevent horizontal scrolling
Conclusion:
By implementing media queries and fluid grids, the website becomes flexible, readable, and usable across all devices, improving accessibility and user satisfaction.
